    "# PYNQ‑Z2 Lab Protocol: Accelerating Conway’s Game of Life with Vitis HLS + Vivado\n",
    "\n",
    "**Audience:** Embedded Systems students\n",
    "**Board:** PYNQ‑Z2 (Zynq‑7020)\n",
    "**Tools:** Vitis HLS, Vivado, Jupyter on PYNQ\n",
    "**Goal:** Implement a hardware accelerator for Conway’s Game of Life (GoL) and compare performance against a software baseline on the PYNQ‑Z2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand when and why bit‑level algorithms (like GoL) benefit from FPGA acceleration.\n",
    "* Use Vitis HLS to synthesize C/C++ into an AXI‑compliant RTL IP core.\n",
    "* Integrate custom HLS IP into a Vivado block design targeting PYNQ‑Z2.\n",
    "* Generate bitstream and hardware handoff (.hwh) suitable for PYNQ overlays.\n",
    "* Control the accelerator from Python in a Jupyter notebook and measure speedup.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "* PYNQ‑Z2 board imaged and reachable over network (Jupyter working).\n",
    "* Tool versions installed on host: Vivado + Vitis HLS (matching versions), PYNQ image compatible with the board.\n",
    "* Provided files:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `gameoflife.cpp` (HLS source with AXI pragmas)\n",
    "  * `gameoflife_tb.cpp` (HLS testbench)\n",
    "  * `gameoflife_soft.ipynb` (PYNQ notebook for CPU implemetation)\n",
    "  * `gameoflife_hard.ipynb` (PYNQ notebook for FPGA implemetation)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Keep the accelerator clock at 100 MHz unless otherwise instructed to match the PS‑generated FCLK0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A — Software baseline on the board\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boot the board** and connect to Jupyter (default user `xilinx`).\n",
    "2. Open the provided **software‑only GoL** notebook.\n",
    "3. **Run one iteration** on a reasonably sized grid (e.g., 1024×1024 or as specified in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Record the **time per iteration** (ms) and any configuration (grid size, number of iterations, seed).\n",
    "4. Save results (you’ll compare against the hardware design later).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B — Build the accelerator IP in Vitis HLS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create project** → *HLS Component* (C/C++). Name it `gol_hls`. Set **Part/Board** to match **PYNQ‑Z2** (or the same Zynq‑7020 part Vivado will use).\n",
    "2. **Add sources:** `gameoflife.cpp`.\n",
    "   Ensure the function top‑level has these interfaces (already in the template):\n",
    "\n",
    "   * AXI4‑Lite for control (start/done, args)\n",
    "   * AXI4 (m_axi) for frame buffers in DDR\n",
    "3. **Add testbench**: `gameoflife_tb.cpp`.\n",
    "4. **C Simulation**: run to verify functional correctness (expected testbench pass).\n",
    "5. **C Synthesis**: target **100 MHz** solution clock. Inspect utilization/timing estimates.\n",
    "6. *(Optional)* **C/RTL Co‑Simulation** to confirm RTL matches C.\n",
    "7. **Package/Export RTL**: *Solution → Export RTL* (package IP).\n",
    "   This creates a reusable IP repository folder (note its path).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part C — Integrate IP in Vivado (Block Design)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **New Vivado Project** → RTL project without default sources. Select **PYNQ‑Z2** as the target **board**.\n",
    "2. **Create Block Design** (e.g., name `system`).\n",
    "3. **Add IP** → **ZYNQ7 Processing System**.\n",
    "4. **Run Block Automation** to configure Zynq for PYNQ‑Z2 (clocks, DDR, MIO). FCLK0 will be available to drive the PL at 100 MHz.\n",
    "5. **Add your HLS IP repository**: *Settings → IP → Repository* → **Add** the folder exported by Vitis HLS.\n",
    "6. **Insert your GoL IP** into the block design.\n",
    "7. **Connect control (AXI‑Lite) interface**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use **Run Connection Automation** to connect the IP’s `s_axi_control` (AXI‑Lite slave) to **PS M_AXI_GP0** via an **AXI Interconnect/SmartConnect**.\n",
    "8. **Enable a PS HP/HPC port and connect IP master (m_axi)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In **ZYNQ7 PS** configuration, enable one **S_AXI_HP0** (or **HPC**) **slave** port.\n",
    "     *(This allows **PL masters** to access DDR through the PS.)*\n",
    "   * Select your IP’s `m_axi` interface and **Run Connection Automation** to attach it to **S_AXI_HP0** (via AXI Interconnect/SmartConnect).\n",
    "9. **Clocks and resets**: Ensure the IP’s `ap_clk` is driven by **FCLK_CLK0 (100 MHz)** and the reset is correctly connected (*Processor System Reset* may be inserted automatically).\n",
    "10. **Address Editor**: Click **Assign All** so the AXI‑Lite control space gets a valid base address.\n",
    "11. **Validate Design** (green check icon). Resolve any DRCs before continuing.\n",
    "12. **Generate HDL Wrapper** for the block design (use **Let Vivado manage wrapper**).\n",
    "13. **Run Synthesis → Implementation → Generate Bitstream**.\n",
    "    When complete, open the implemented design and re‑validate if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artifacts to locate** (names will reflect your BD name, often `system`):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bitstream: `.../project.runs/impl_1/system_wrapper.bit`\n",
    "* Hardware handoff: `system.hwh` (commonly under `.../project.srcs/sources_1/bd/system/` or `.../project.gen/sources_1/bd/system/`).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If unsure, search the project directory for `*.hwh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part D — Deploy overlay files to PYNQ\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a base name (e.g., `gol`). **Rename** your files so base names **match**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `gol.bit`\n",
    "   * `gol.hwh`\n",
    "2. Copy files and notebook to the board (example using `scp`):\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   scp gol.bit gol.hwh notebook_gol.ipynb xilinx@<board_ip>:/home/xilinx/jupyter_notebooks/gol/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. On the board, confirm the files are in the destination folder and names match exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part E — Run the hardware‑accelerated notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open `gameoflife_hard.ipynb` on the board.\n",
    "2. The notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Load the overlay: `Overlay('gol.bit')`\n",
    "   * Set up buffers and parameters\n",
    "   * Launch the accelerator and collect timings\n",
    "3. **Measure and record**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Time/iteration (hardware)\n",
    "   * Speedup vs. Part A baseline\n",
    "   * Correctness: final board state matches CPU reference for the same initial grid and iteration count\n",
    "4. Save results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables (per student/team)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Baseline CPU time/iteration and configuration used.\n",
    "* FPGA time/iteration, configuration, and calculated speedup.\n",
    "* Screenshot of Vivado **Block Design** showing connections.\n",
    "* Short note on any design decisions (clock, data widths) and issues encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting & tips\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IP not visible in Vivado**: Confirm you added the **correct repository path** (the folder containing `component.xml`). Click *Refresh*.\n",
    "* **m_axi connection fails**: Ensure **S_AXI_HP0/HPC** is **enabled** in ZYNQ PS and use **Connection Automation** to insert the proper interconnect.\n",
    "* **Address conflicts**: Open **Address Editor** and use **Assign All** or manually choose a free range.\n",
    "* **Timing warnings in HLS**: Re‑synthesize at 100 MHz or adjust pragmas (unroll/partition) after the basic flow is working.\n",
    "* **Naming for PYNQ**: `.bit` and `.hwh` **must share the exact same base name** (e.g., `gol.bit` & `gol.hwh`).\n",
    "* **Clock domain**: Keep the accelerator on **FCLK0 @ 100 MHz** unless you’ve planned constraints across domains.\n",
    "* **Correctness checks**: Compare a few iterations (including edge cases and wrap/no‑wrap rules matching your implementation) against the software version.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional extensions (time permitting)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Try different **grid sizes** and measure scaling.\n",
    "* Experiment with **data packing** (e.g., bit‑packing 32 or 64 cells per word) and observe bandwidth effects.\n",
    "* Enable a **second FCLK** and explore higher clock rates after validating at 100 MHz.\n"
